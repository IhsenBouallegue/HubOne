### Built With

Hub One is built with the amazing [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) framework that in turn is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/). The beautiful UI components are built using [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/). It uses [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database for all the links and bookmarks. With the help of [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) -a database ORM- quereying is a breeze and totally database-agnostic.
For deployment we used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to create containers that are easily deployable (for development and prodcution).


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run Hub One **locally** you will need:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): A package manager for JavaScript.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/): For running the containers locally.

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the github repo
git clone https://github.com/IhsenBouallegue/hub-one
# Install the dependencies
yarn install
```

## Usage

We have set up yarn scripts that will use docker compose files to launch the Hub One container and the PostgreSQL Database.

```sh
# Laucnh development containers

```
